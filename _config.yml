# Hi — I'm Jack 👋
I'm a cybersecurity & networking student who learns fast and gets things done. I’m finishing up coursework at Central Washington University and I love hands-on labs — subnetting, router/switch config, packet analysis, and automation. I also build Arduino projects and small web tools.

**Quick facts**
- Major: Cybersecurity / Networking
- Tools: Cisco Packet Tracer, Wireshark, Linux (bash), Python
- Projects: networking labs (static & floating routes), phishing detection walkthroughs, Arduino builds (timers, motors)
- Interests: security automation, incident response, embedded systems

## Featured projects
- **CIS-Networking-Lab-Scripts** — Subnetting guides, router configs, and verification scripts.
- **phish-detection-playbook** — Phishing analysis walkthrough, IOC extraction scripts, sandboxing notes.
- **arduino-hourglass** — Digital hourglass and motor control code used in class projects.

## Want to work together?
I’m open to internships and entry-level roles in cybersecurity and networking. Email: jack.holmstrom@example.com · LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/jack-holmstrom
